# Array ADT
Welcome to the Array Abstract Data Type (ADT) section of the Data Structures and Algorithm repository. This folder contains conceptual explanations, implementations, and sample problems related to arrays — one of the most fundamental and widely used data structures.

## 📌 What is an Array ADT?
The Array ADT (Abstract Data Type) represents a fixed-size collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. It allows:
- Constant-time access to elements using index-based addressing.
- Efficient iteration and traversal.
- Basic operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and updating.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
By exploring this folder, you will:
- Understand the internal working and limitations of static and dynamic arrays.
- Implement core array operations from scratch.
- Practice solving array-based problems to strengthen your algorithmic thinking.

## ⏱️ Time Complexities (for static arrays)
1. Access -	O(1)
2. Insertion -	O(n)
3. Deletion -	O(n)
4. Search -	O(n) / O(log n)
5. Traversal -	O(n)

## ✅ Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C
- Familiarity with variables, loops, and functions
- Interest in understanding low-level memory and data handling
