# Queue ADT  
Welcome to the Queue Abstract Data Type (ADT) section of the Data Structures and Algorithms repository. This folder contains conceptual explanations, implementations, and sample problems related to queues — a fundamental linear data structure used in various real-world and system-level applications.

## 📌 What is a Queue ADT?  
The Queue ADT (Abstract Data Type) represents a collection of elements arranged in a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** order. Elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front. It supports:
- Controlled access via enqueue and dequeue operations.
- Useful modeling of real-world queues like customer service lines or task scheduling.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives  
By exploring this folder, you will:  
- Understand the internal working of linear and circular queues.  
- Implement core queue operations from scratch.  
- Practice solving queue-based problems to build algorithmic intuition.

## 📝 Languages Used  
C (can be extended to other languages as needed)

## ⚙️ Key Operations Covered  
1. Enqueue (Insert at rear)  
2. Dequeue (Remove from front)  
3. Peek/Front (View front element)  
4. IsEmpty / IsFull checks  
5. Circular Queue implementation  

## ⏱️ Time Complexities  
1. Enqueue - O(1)  
2. Dequeue - O(1)  
3. Peek - O(1)  
4. Traversal (if applicable) - O(n)  

## ✅ Prerequisites  
- Basic understanding of C  
- Familiarity with variables, loops, and functions  
- Interest in real-world application of FIFO data structures
